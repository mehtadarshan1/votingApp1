# votingApp1

1. As a PHP-Postgresql page at a time application. Create a Postgresql schema, add all users to the schema at the very start, so only those previously added can vote. Also, add an authentication page. Users authenticate by putting in their userid and password, checked against your database. Once authenticated, a user has a session with some variables in it indicating the fact that they are logged in. When the user votes, their vote is stored in the database. Additionally, the current vote tally is listed on the page. A user can only contribute one vote, but can change their preference at any time. Use sessions.

2. Split the above application into a 3 page application, login, about, and vote. Style the above webpage with some interesting CSS, including adding a tabbed menu, turning the navigation on the left in this to a top tabbed navigation like this, or this. You don't need Javascript for this in a page at a time applications though.
